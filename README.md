# 🚗 Fuel Consumption Prediction

Welcome to the **Fuel Consumption Prediction** project! 🎉 This repository is dedicated to comparing and evaluating the performance of several machine learning models for predicting fuel consumption. We will utilize various techniques, including Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and AdaBoost, to identify the best model for this task.

## 📋 Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following Python packages:

- `numpy` 📊
- `pandas` 🧾
- `scikit-learn` 🔍
- `tensorflow` or `keras` (for Neural Networks) 🧠
- `matplotlib` (optional, for visualization) 📈

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
```

## 🏆 Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** 📉
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** 📏
- **R-squared (R²) scores** 📐

The model with the best performance based on these metrics will be identified as the most effective for predicting fuel consumption.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions! 🚀
